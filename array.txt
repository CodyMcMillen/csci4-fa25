An array is a list that can contain any type of character. A list is a collection of things in one structure. They can be numbers, characters, booleans, and collections. I made two different types of arrays, a short array and a long array. I used .pop so I can get just the last number in the list which in this case was 26 for a and 5 for b. After it gets those numbers it prints them.
